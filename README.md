# Classification
Classification models using the MNIST dataset.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook demonstrating various Machine Learning principles and applies them to some classification models.
The models we mainly focus on are:
  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  K Nearest Neighbors CLassifier (KNN)

Fair warning the Jupyter Notebook can take a decent amount of time to run but most of that runtime is the models and cross validation scores in the last two cells. For my mid level machine it took about 45-60 minutes.
